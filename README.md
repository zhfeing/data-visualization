# Data Visualization

This repo is created for the sake of drawing sci-style figures with free softwares (e.g. `matplotlib` and `seaborn`).

Currently there are plenty of choices to draw sci-style figures, such as `Gnuplot`, `Origin-Lab`. However, based on python, `matplotlib` are powerful tools to work with powerful abilities and programmable behaviors. With carefully designed style and layout settings, we can plot figures similar to those generated by `Origin-Lab`, which is a commercial software.

## Basic Functions and APIs

1. Draw Bars

    ```python
    def draw_bar(
        axes: Axes,
        bar_cfg: Dict[str, Any],
        draw_cfg: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> Tuple[Figure, Axes]:
        ...
    ```

    This function draw a **vertical** bar plot with the given axes.

    Configurations:
    1. `bar_cfg`
        * `data` is a `DataFrame` contains a set of bar data, including position and error (*optional*).

        Example:

        ||method|AP|err_n|err_p|
        |-|-|-|-|-|
        |0|Redundancy|47.8321|0.4|0.3|
        |1|Isometric|47.2445|0.2|0.4|
        |2|Random|45.53119|0.2|0.3|
        |3|SAG|44.64032|0.2|0.2|

        * `error` is an *optional* `dict` contains error type and corresponding to the keys in `bar_cfg`. Default `None`.

        ```yaml
        error: # dict
            err_pos: err_p # positive error
            err_neg: err_n # negative error, optional if errors are symmetric
        ```

        * `x_axis` is the column name of the *x* axis in `data`
        * `y_axis` is the column name of the *y* axis in `data`

    2. `draw_cfg`:

2. Draw Heatmap

3. Draw Lines
